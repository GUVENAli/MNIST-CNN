6 hidden layers and 28x28 input, 10 categorical outputs
Three different batch size were tried to determine which one showed better performance.
Early stopping, learning rate update and model check point callback functions were used to avoide overfitting.
To improve test score, dilation and erosion morphological methods were used.
