6 hidden layers and 28x28 input, 10 categorical outputs.<br/>
Three different batch size were tried to determine which one showed better performance.<br/>
Early stopping, learning rate update and model check point callback functions were used to avoide overfitting.<br/>
To improve test score, dilation and erosion morphological methods were used.
